<h1>Sign Language Conversion</h1>
<p>The project leverages Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV to create a real-time sign language to text and speech generation system. MediaPipe, a popular library for computer vision and machine learning, is employed to perform hand gesture recognition, allowing the system to interpret sign language. OpenCV, a versatile computer vision library, complements MediaPipe by providing robust image and video processing capabilities.

The dataset used for training the model likely consists of annotated images or videos containing diverse sign language gestures. This dataset is crucial for teaching the machine learning model to accurately recognize and interpret different signs. Python serves as the primary programming language for implementing the project, offering flexibility and ease of integration with both MediaPipe and OpenCV.

The system's workflow involves capturing video input, processing it using OpenCV to extract relevant features, and then utilizing MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition. The recognized gestures are then mapped to corresponding text and speech outputs. This innovative project showcases the synergy between Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV, providing an accessible and inclusive solution for bridging communication gaps between individuals who use sign language and those who may not be familiar with it.</p>
